**The structure of folders is shown below:**
* src
* features.train.bin
* features.test.bin
* input.train.txt
* input.test.txt

Which `src` contains the code of making features and making it ready for the mallet tool.
And input files are those who are given to a **mellet** command and generate `features.train.bin` and `features.test.bin` which are the mallet standard input formats.
`Input` and `Input_2` are for before optimization and after that.(model1 and model2)
