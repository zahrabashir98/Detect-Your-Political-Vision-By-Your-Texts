# ClsModel/Maxent

**The structure of folders is shown below:**
* /src
* * /after_optimization
* /before_optimization
* model.bin
* Test.errors.txt
* Test.output.txt
* Test.report.txt
* ReadMe.md

I think the files are clear as are told in the document.
I only added `before_optimization` and `after_optimization` folders which contain all data and models (input and output) of two steps of making model better

Actually the better results are put as main results in my homework.
