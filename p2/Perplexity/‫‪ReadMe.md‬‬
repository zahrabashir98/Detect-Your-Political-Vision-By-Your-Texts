# Perplexity


At the beginning if you run the following file you will see these sentences on terminal:
#### path : Perplexity/src/main.py
`python3 main.py`

> What is your language model type?
> 1)unigram
> 2)bigram
> 3)trigram
> 4)test for my own data automatically


#### You will choose one of them and continue
* if you choose 4 no need to do anything ... just watch the result :)
* if you choose one of 1 to 3 the system will ask you the followings:

> Enter your Language model URL: --> 
> Enter your input text URL -->

Notice that these paths are according to the relative path of the folder :
##### e.g :
##### your state: Perplexity/src
##### example : ../../Model/label1.1gram.lm
##### example: ../../SplitData/ImamKhomeini/test/label1.txt

And finally you will see the results in the terminal :)
