# SRILM
I have put some of my results here
You can see the full documentation f my results in `output` folder.

## Language Model
You can see the results in output folder named `lm1.lm` and `lm2.lm` for both label1 and label2.

## Perplexity :
**SRILM ouputs :**
(Bigram results)
test_label_1
file label1_test.txt: 1 sentences, 3101 words, 419 OOVs
0 zeroprobs, logprob= -7856.963 ppl= 848.0562 ppl1= 850.1911

test_label_2
file label2_test.txt: 1 sentences, 3241 words, 429 OOVs
0 zeroprobs, logprob= -8950.253 ppl= 1519.66 ppl1= 1523.624

**My outputs**

test_label1:
 ppl = 1512.50 for bigrams
test_label2:

As you can see the results are approximately the same as SRILM's outputs.
