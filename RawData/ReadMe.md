# Subject And Language of Data:
My subject is about Two differnet speakers in the same period of time such as `ImamKhomeini` and `MohammadRezaPahlavi`
I can actually extend it into larger subject such : **Revolutionaries** vs **Anti-revolutionaries**
The language of my data is **Persian**

# Why it is intresting for me ?
That is an amazing system. suppose that you can give your speeces to this system and then you will undrestand that which group are you more similar to ?
I am totally very intersted in these fields :))

# Resourses:
I gathered the text of different speeches at valid sites such as [this link](https://mashruteh.org/wiki/index.php?title=%D8%B3%D8%AE%D9%86%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C_%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7_%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87_%D9%BE%D9%87%D9%84%D9%88%DB%8C_%D8%A2%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87%D8%B1) and [this one](https://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/770100/%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%86-%D9%88-%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%88%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%B3%D8%AE%D9%86%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AE%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%B2%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7-%DB%B1%DB%B2-%D8%A8%D9%87%D9%85%D9%86-%DB%B5%DB%B7)
There are enough textes of the available speeches

# Data gathering:
Actually my Data gathering didn't have any complexity or special API. I just could find my data on the different web pages mentioned :D
I put all of the data I gathered in `RawData` folder as .txt files.
The only seperator is that ImamKhomeini's speeches have `Imam` in their file_name and MohammadRezaPahlavi's speeches have `Shah` in their file_name.
